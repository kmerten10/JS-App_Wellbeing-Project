How It's Made:

Tech used: HTML/CSS, JavaScript, scoring logic, Docker (image & contanerization)

This is an original project inspired by my passion for health and wellbeing. While reinforcing JavaScript concepts, this project developed my skills in ideation and UX design concepts including visual and functional design, usability, information architecture and user research.

Optimizations:
Implementing a backend that stores user scores from the previous day
Implementing a feature that displays a user's score from the previous day

Lessons Learned:
This project utilized skills that I had already developed, with the exception of the scoring system. I improved my documentation skills during this project and believe I maintained a well organized code base with clearly defined notes. I relied heavily on external resources for this project and need to revisit the capability notes to better understand how to implement the functionality more independently.
